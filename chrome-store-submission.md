## Technical Information

### Permissions Required
- `clipboardWrite`: Required to copy text to the system clipboard
- `activeTab`: Required to inject content script into web pages

### Permissions Justification
```
clipboardWrite: This permission is essential for the core functionality of the extension - copying tooltip text to the user's clipboard. The extension uses the modern Clipboard API (navigator.clipboard.writeText) to safely write text content only.

activeTab: This permission allows the extension to inject its content script into the currently active tab, enabling it to detect hover events and extract tooltip text from web pages. No data is transmitted or stored.
```
